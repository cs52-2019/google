# Google Earth Engine and the Accountability Counsel
CS 52: CS+Social Good Studio, Winter-Spring 2019

Sofia Avila, Alexandra Camargo, Claire Huang, and Tyler Vo

## Our Partner Organizations
[The Accountability Counsel](https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/) (AC) is a group of lawyers and statisticians who help vulnerable communities around the world build and file cases against multinational corporations that threaten their environmental, economic, and social well-being. 

[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) provides an extensive catalog of time-series satellite imagery and geospatial datasets across the globe. We were lucky enough to be partnered with Earth Engine engineers who have been helping us identify datasets and providing technical implementation guidance.

## The Challenge
Satellite imagery data can be very valuable for accountability metrics like tracking the growth of large-scale construction projects or keeping an eye on air and water pollution levels. However, the current process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing quantitative satellite imagery data over time for specific cases is a very manual and time-consuming process for lawyers at AC. 

## Our Solution
Our goal is to provide an intuitive web interface for the Accountability Counsel to view and analyze time series satellite imagery data. In particular, we hope to provide value in these four AC-specific goals:
1. Simplify the powerful but overwhelming Earth Engine interface 
2. Automatically identify salient events (eg. large changes in the quantity tracked) over time
3. Offer more flexible options for specifying what location(s) to track
4. Make findings easily shareable so the work can be cross-checked

## Our Development Timeline
Week | Milestone | Details | Status
--- | --- | --- | ---
2 | Framework rough draft; Django tutorials | Discuss rough ideas for necessary frontend pages/components and database schema. Begin setting them up as scaffolding in code. | :construction: In progress
3 | Rudimentary page flow + database; Earth Engine API calls | Prototype Earth Engine API calls with our desired parameters (location, time, datasets) in a standalone Javascript and then Python script. Probably ask GEE mentors for help. |
4 | Current case landing and case details; Earth Engine API calls |  |
5 | Current case new analysis; Earth Engine integration | |
6 | Current case new analysis | |
7 | Current case new analysis, analysis details | |
8 | New case, past cases | |
9 | Buffer time | |
10 | Prepare for showcase! | |
